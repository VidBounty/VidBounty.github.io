<FONT SIZE=3><B>Points</B></FONT>

&quot;Points&quot; in the VidBounty app are earnable tokens that may be redeemed for rewards. We reserve the right to alter or remove rewards, points, or means of earning points at our sole discretion with no prior notice.

We may remove points from accounts inactive for a period longer than 3 months, or points that have been held for a period longer than one year.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Points Transferability</B></FONT>

Points are not transferable. You may not sell, barter, or gift points. Any points found to have been transferred will be removed.

Points may be redeemed in exchange for rewards. If a given reward is not available, we may deliver a reward of equal value. Delivery of rewards, like delivery and retention of points, may be cancelled if we determine a violation of terms has occurred.

 * Any modification of our software or access to our network or servers via unauthorized software.
 * The use, on your device, of macros or other programs capable of interacting with our service without direct user input, especially the use of said programs to accrue points.
 * Use of our Service in excess of what we determine to be reasonable human use; for instance watching videos to earn points for every hour of the day, as would be expected of a macro program.
